Mazen Finance introduces an advanced ve(3,3) mechanism, building upon the foundations laid by pioneering protocols while incorporating significant optimizations tailored for the evolving DeFi landscape, particularly in the realm of Real World Assets (RWAs).
The ve(3,3) model, at its core, combines vote-escrowed governance (ve) with a balanced reward system that incentivizes both liquidity provision and long-term token holding. In Mazen's implementation:

Vote-Escrowed Governance (ve):
Users lock MAZEN tokens to receive veMAZEN, granting voting rights and boosted rewards. Our optimization extends this concept by allowing veMAZEN holders to direct emissions not just to traditional crypto pairs, but also to RWA-focused liquidity pools, fostering a diverse and robust ecosystem.

Balanced Reward System (3,3):
We've enhanced the traditional (3,3) mechanism to create a more sustainable and efficient reward structure:

Liquidity providers earn MAZEN emissions and a share of trading fees.
veMAZEN holders receive protocol fees, bribes, and governance power.
Our unique addition: veMAZEN holders also benefit from $MUSD rebases, providing an additional yield stream tied to real-world performance.
