mazUSD is a multi-asset backed stablecoin integrated into the Mazen protocol. It's designed as a 100% collateralized RWA stablecoin, pegged to a basket of stable assets. The backing assets include other RWA tokens, $USDM, $USDC, $USDT, and $DAI. These stablecoins are deployed into audited yield strategies to generate a steady revenue stream.

mazUSD offers dynamic yield to investors, with returns calculated and distributed approximately every 24 hours. This yield is allocated to token holders and liquidity providers.

A key feature of mazUSD is its role in the protocol's incentive structure. Liquidity pairs involving mazUSD (such as mazUSD/ETH) receive APY bonuses. Moreover, the yield generated from the RWA assets is used to automatically bribe voters for mazUSD-related pools.

This mechanism aims to create a sustainable, self-reinforcing flywheel effect. By providing a consistent source of bribes, it addresses the challenge of maintaining long-term incentives in the ve(3,3) model. The goal is to ensure stable liquidity and ongoing interest in mazUSD pairs, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Mazen ecosystem.
