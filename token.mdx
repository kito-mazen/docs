## $Mazen 
$Mazen  serves as the lifeblood of the Mazen Finance ecosystem, offering unparalleled liquidity and versatility. As an ERC-20 token, it opens doors to a multitude of opportunities within our platform.

## veMazen
veMZN, the cornerstone of Mazen Finance, is an innovative ERC-721 NFT that revolutionizes governance participation. 

By locking $MZN tokens, users forge veMZN, gaining a powerful tool to shape the protocol's future. This dynamic asset allows holders to guide revenue distribution, participate in governance decisions, and attract rewards through a unique ve(3,3) mechanism. 

veMZN's influence grows with lock duration, encourages active engagement through its waning power, and offers flexibility in position management. Through weekly voting, veMZN holders orchestrate MZN incentives, harvest trading fees, and collect bribes, all while being protected by an anti-dilution shield. 

This multi-faceted token not only empowers users to be key decision-makers in Mazen's ecosystem but also rewards their participation, creating a symbiotic relationship between the protocol and its community.


## $mazUSD   

mazUSD is a multi-asset backed stablecoin integrated into the Mazen protocol. It’s designed as a 100% collateralized RWA stablecoin, pegged to a basket of stable assets. The backing assets include other RWA tokens, USDM, USDC, USDT, sUSDe, FRAX..etc.

mazUSD offers dynamic yield to investors, with returns calculated and distributed approximately every 24 hours. This yield is allocated to token holders and liquidity providers.

A key feature of mazUSD is its role in the protocol’s incentive structure. Liquidity pairs involving mazUSD (such as mazUSD/ETH) receive APY bonuses. Moreover, the yield generated from the RWA assets is used to automatically bribe voters for mazUSD-related pools.

This mechanism aims to create a sustainable, self-reinforcing flywheel effect. By providing a consistent source of bribes, it addresses the challenge of maintaining long-term incentives in the ve(3,3) model. The goal is to ensure stable liquidity and ongoing interest in mazUSD pairs, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Mazen ecosystem.
