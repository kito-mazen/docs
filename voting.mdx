Our ve(3,3) mechanism forms the core of Mazen's governance, optimizing protocol rewards and liquidity allocation. Users lock MZN to mint veMZN NFTs, gaining voting rights proportional to their lock duration. This system incentivizes long-term commitment and aligns stakeholder interests with protocol growth.

VeMZN holders direct emissions to RWA liquidity pairs via our Gauge system. Weekly epochs allow for dynamic adjustment of reward distribution, ensuring capital efficiency and responsiveness to market conditions.

Governance extends to protocol-wide decisions, with proposals covering parameter adjustments, feature implementations, and strategic initiatives. A transparent bribe marketplace adds another layer of incentivization, allowing stakeholders to offer additional rewards for votes on specific Gauges.
